    - **Must** include application demo

## Details

- Application must be written in Java.
- Application must include persistence (CSV, JSON, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- Application must include at least two (2) class objects/models.
    - Not Repo or Service Layer, such as Expense model. 
- Application should demonstrate proper separation of concerns using Repo/Service Layers. 
    - Architectural Structure, Service Layers, separation of concerns.
- Application should continue to run until user decides to exit. 
- Handle Errors/Exceptions gracefully, and should exit appropriately. 

- Persisted Data must include multiple types of objects from the application.
    - (2) models from above.
- Persisted Data must include at least one (1) many-to-many relationship. 
    - If persisting in SQL, data must be normalize to 3NF. 

## Ideas? 
- Perhaps some sort of searching? Vector searching? 
    - Ah maybe I could do music searching, this would easily allow for persistence
    - Songs can have many artists and Artists can have many songs -> Many-to-Many
    - Analyze the bigrams, trigrams, n-grams or utilize a vectorize word2vec model
     - Cache? Might allow for additional table's and relationships.
